The stakes are high for the U.S. pork industry under a volatile relationship between the U.S. and China.

 - `python - pandas`
 - `Datawrapper`
 - `JavaScript`
 - `regex`
 - `csv`

### A Break Down of Files:
 - `analysis.ipynb`: the jupyter notebook where I did my analysis on pork imported to China market.
  - `ggplot_dist.ipynb`: data analysis on U.S. pork export.
 - `cleaned_output.csv`: the curated dataset after my categorization of majors into four disciplines - Business, Science, Social Science and Humanities. 
 - `offals_us.csv`: total amount in USD of pork offals exported to global trader parnters.
  - `treemap.csv`: a spreadsheet which eventually presented through a treemap that shows the total number of doctoral enrollments in 2024 by discipline. 
 - `phd_stipends.csv`: the original dataset that contains all financial information about nationalwide stipends across discipines. 
 - static_imgs: charts and graphics you find in my article.
  - `privater.csv` and `public.csv`: data about English PhD stipends in public universities and private universities.
